#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Could you explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry? 
* Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. 
Its importance in the technology industry;- Software engineering has enabled organizations to upscale their IT infrastructure and gain access to high-quality, reliable solutions that enhance efficiency.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) Development of programming languages;- Done by Fortran in 1957 which was marked as the first high-level programming language released, previous programmers only wrote machine code to control the computer's hardware.
2) Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s; It was during this time there was a software crisis due to a shortage of qualified software developers/unreliable and prone to bugs software etc.
3) Advent of structured programming done 1970s; Methodologies were developed that included structured and object-oriented programming after the first NATO software engineering conference held in 1968.


3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Planning:- this is where the purpose, options, and expected outcome are tabled for strategizing.
2) Requirement Analysis:- Here an analysis of the data collected is done to identify essential features from desirable ones and get a clear understanding of the functionality, security, performance, and interface needed for the software.
3) Design:- A framework is built to help outline the structure, user interfaces, navigation, and database for the software.
4) Coding:- This is where software designs are converted into tangible code by making it functional, user-friendly, and efficient.
5) Testing:- This is done to check for bugs/glitches to ensure smooth software operation before it reaches its end-users.
6) Deployment: This is the stage where the end-users get to interact with the software. 
7) Maintenance:- This involves constant assistance and improvement to ensure the software gives the best functions and meets the customers' expectations.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
* Waterfall is a more rigid structure that encourages the completion of deliverables to progress to the next phase, and will work best with projects that have strict regulations and requirements  whereas Agile is flexible and thus enables changes even late in the process, and is best used in projects that have owners/stakeholder involvement.


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
* Software developers:- Design, write the code, implement, and maintain software solutions
* Quality Assurance Engineer:- Helps in testing software functionalities, identifying bugs, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
* Project Manager:- oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
* IDES:- It helps developers manage code by reducing manual tasks, decreasing debugging time, and offering essential code management functionalities. ie visual studio
* VCS:- Allows developers to track code changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions of their code. Ie Git

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1) Rapid change in technology- learning and staying updated with the relevant concept.
2) Time constraints- Ensure proper time projections are done and communicated.
3) Growing customer demands- Ensure the purpose and functionality of the software are well outlined to meet consumers' expectations.
4) Limited infrastructure - ensure you quote right in a project to accommodate all required resources.


8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
*Unit testing:- This involves isolating individual code functions/ classes and testing them independently. It helps detect code errors earlier thus building cleaner, manageable code
* Integration testing:- This shows how individual software components work together after the unit test. Helps identify incompatible interfaces, and timing issues across modules and reduces regression risk.
* System Test:- This is the overall functionality and performance of the software system. It helps detect system issues such as performance bottlenecks and security weaknesses.
* Acceptance Test:- It's the final stage of software testing that ensures the software meets the business requirements and user expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


9. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
* it is designing creative, instructional questions and statements to get responses from an AI model. It helps make clear and specific questions for the AI model to generate a better and exact response needed from the AI model.
  
10. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    
*The improved prompt has given better specifications with a rich history of the specific make.
